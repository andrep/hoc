<h1>Adding a GUI to an Expression Parser</h1>

<p>You've probably seen many examples of Haskell GUI libraries which show you
how to create a simple graphical application that has a cute little button
which prints "Hello, world!" when you click on it.  Well, we'd show you that,
but the truth is it's so easy to do with Cocoa that it'd just be boring (as
well as being useless).  So, let's do something a bit more practical with our
first example: our mission is to put a simple GUI around a basic Haskell
program, which is something you're more likely to be interested in.</p>

<p>For this quick tour, let's write a GUI program that allows a user to type in
arithmetic expressions (e.g. <code>2+5</code> or <code>69*33/3+15</code>), and
print its result.  Something like this will do:</p>

<p>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="screenshots/ExpressionParser.png" class="bordered">
    </td>

    <td>
      <img src="screenshots/ExpressionParser_error.png" class="bordered">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>In comparison to other GUI toolkits available for Haskell, there's a bit
more of a learning curve to use HOC for writing GUIs, because Cocoa enforces
good design by separating your application logic cleanly using design patterns
such as <a
  href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter02/chapter_2_section_3.html">Model-View-Controller</a>
(which we will use in this example).  So, while this quick tour may seem a bit
longer than you expect, the really good news is that Cocoa's design patterns
<em>scale</em> very well: writing a small GUI may take 50-100 lines of code,
but writing a much bigger, fancy GUI with lots of widgets and controls may only
take 100-200 lines rather than 500-1000, because much of the GUI code is
handled for you by Interface Builder's target-action/outlet design.  In Mac OS
X Panther, you can even use <a
  href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html">Cocoa
  Bindings</a> with your Haskell application, and cut down your code size even
further.</p>

<p>Note that HOC is also a lower-level binding than higher-level GUI toolkits
such as <a
  href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/ComputingScience/Research/Functional/Fudgets/">Fudgets</a>
or even <a href="http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/">wxHaskell</a>: it is really
a bridge which enables you to use Objective-C objects from Haskell (and thus
gives you much more functionality than simply being able to write GUIs!).  In
the future, we hope to layer a higher-level interface on top of HOC to provide
a more functional API, so you're not forced into imperative style of coding as
you would write Objective-C code.  Even so, the Cocoa framework is so well
designed that the resulting imperative code is still far shorter than it would
be compared to most other frameworks .</p>

<h2>The Model: an Arithmetic Expression Parser</h2>

<p>Our first step is to write the arithmetic expression parser.  To do this, we
could use Daan Leijen's most excellent <a
  href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/parsec.html">Parsec</a> parser combinator
library.  In fact, Parsec comes with such excellent documentation that it even
gives <a
  href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/download/parsec/parsec.html#Expressions">example
  code</a> which shows how to do this.  So, imagine the following code is in an
<code>ExpressionParser.hs</code> Haskell module:</a>

<div class="inner-box">
  <pre>module ExpressionParser

where

import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec
import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.Expr

expr :: Parser Integer
expr = buildExpressionParser table factor &lt;?&gt; "expression"

table = [ [op "*" (*) AssocLeft, op "/" div AssocLeft]
	, [op "+" (+) AssocLeft, op "-" (-) AssocLeft] ]
  where
    op s f assoc = Infix (do { string s; return f }) assoc

factor = do { char '('; x &lt;- expr; char ')'; return x }
	 &lt;|&gt; number
	 &lt;?&gt; "simple expression"

number :: Parser Integer
number = do { ds &lt;- many1 digit; return (read ds) } &lt;?&gt; "number"
</pre>
</div>

<p>There's probably around 10 lines of code there, but if you
run the code in GHCi, it seems to work quite well:</p>

<div class="inner-box">
<pre>*ExpressionParser&gt; parseTest expr "2+5*2"
12
*ExpressionParser&gt; parseTest expr "69/3+1"
24
</pre>
</div>

<p>So, you have a working expression parser.  Unfortunately, you have to to run
this from GHCi to use it.  You could write a command-line interface to it, but
wouldn't it be nicer if you could run it from a Haskell GUI instead?</p>

<h2>The View: a GUI for the Expression Parser</h2>

<p>Now that you've written the model, it's time to write the <em>view</em>,
which lets the user interact with the model by clicking on buttons, selecting
menu items, and all that fancy GUI stuff.  Luckily, the Cocoa framework on Mac
OS X makes this quite trivial: instead of writing tedious layout code to draw
the view, set up the menus, etc., we use <a
  href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/interfacebuilder/">Interface
  Builder</a>, a GUI design tool.  Briefly, the steps involved with Interface
Builder are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Drag the text fields and buttons from the Cocoa Controls palette into
  your window.</li>

  <li>Tell Interface Builder that you'll be writing a class called
  <code>EPController</code> to handle events such as the user clicking on
  buttons.  To do this, you simply subclass and instantiate the
  <code>NSObject</code> class (the root of all of Cocoa's classes) in Interface
  Builder's Classes window.</li>

  <li>Add two <em>outlets</em> to the <code>EPController</code> class, which
  are pointers to the two text fields in the window.  This enables your
  controller class to read the user's typed-in expression from the first text
  field, and write its output to the second text field.</li>

  <li>Add an <em>action</em> to the <code>EPController</code> class, which
  contains the expression-evaluation code that will run when the user clicks on
  the "Evaluate" button (or presses the <em>Enter</em> key in the input text
  field).</li>

  <li><em>Connect</em> the text fields to <code>EPController</code>'s outlets
  by Ctrl-dragging from the instantiated <code>EPController</code> object to
  the text field, and setting the outlet appropriately.  You also want to
  connect the Evaluate button and text field entry to
  <code>EPController</code>'s, again by Ctrl-dragging from them to the
  instantiated <code>EPController</code> object icon.</li>

</ul>

<p>That's it: your view's done.  You could write all this code programmatically
of course, but why bother?  Interface Builder allows you to add GUIs to your
code very rapidly, and also handles issues such as window re-sizing elegantly.
(This is often quoted as a reason to manually write code&mdash;so you can use
a geometry manager&mdash;rather than using a GUI designer tool.  Truth is,
Cocoa and Interface Builder's re-sizing controls are so easy and powerful that
you'll very rarely have to write any geometry management code&mdash;I've
<em>never</em> had to, even when writing a full-fledged media player
application!)  Here's a screenshot of what Interface Builder will look like as
you're designing your view with it:</p>

<h2>The Controller: Handling User Interaction</h2>

<p>Now that you've written the model and the view, it's time to write the
<em>controller</em>, which the view sends messages to in response to user
interactions.  The controller is responsible for calling the appopriate
functions in the model, and delivering the model's outputs to the view.  In
this case, that means delivering the expression the user typed in to the
<code>ExpressionParser</code> module's parsing code, taking the parser's
output, and displaying that back in the view.</p>

<p>HOC enables you to write the controller's code in pure Haskell: first, you
need to write a <code>Selectors.hs</code> file which declares all the
<em>selectors</em> (method names) that you will be using:</p>

<div class="inner-box">
<pre>{-# OPTIONS -fglasgow-exts #-}

module Selectors where

import AppKit.NSButton

$(declareSelector "evaluateExpression:" [t| forall a. NSButton a -&gt; IO () |])
</pre>
</div>

<p>This enables better static checking of method names, and prevents scenarios
such as pondering why your method wasn't being called when you actually
misspelled it (which can happen with Objective-C).  After this, it's time to
write the controller code:</p>

<div class="inner-box">
<pre>{-# OPTIONS -fglasgow-exts #-}

module EPController where

import Cocoa hiding (parse)
import ExpressionParser
import Selectors
import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec (parse)

$(declareClass "EPController" "NSObject")

$(exportClass "EPController" "ep_"
  [ Outlet "expressionEntry" [t| NSTextField () |]
  , Outlet "evaluation"      [t| NSTextField () |]
  , InstanceMethod Selectors.info_evaluateExpression ])

obj #. var = obj # getIVar var

ep_evaluateExpression _ self = do
  -- Get the expressionEntry outlet text field from this object, and get
  -- what the user typed as a Haskell string
  expression &lt;- self #. _expressionEntry &gt;&gt;= stringValue &gt;&gt;= haskellString
  -- Parse the expression
  case (parse expr "" expression) of
    Left err -&gt;
      -- Parsing returned an error: display it in the output text field      
      self #. _evaluation &gt;&gt;= setStringValue (toNSString $ "Error " ++ show err)
    Right answer -&gt;
      -- Parsing was successful: display the answer
      self #. _evaluation &gt;&gt;= setStringValue (toNSString $ show answer)
</pre>
</div>

<p>That's it: you've just added a pretty GUI to your expression parser.  Once
again, here's what the result looks like:</p>

<p>
<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="4">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="screenshots/ExpressionParser.png" class="bordered">
    </td>

    <td>
      <img src="screenshots/ExpressionParser_error.png" class="bordered">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Of course, this is only a quick overview on how to use HOC: this brief look
at HOC is expanded upon in the HOC <a
  href="documentation.html">documentation</a>, where we describe the exact
steps involved in building this arithmetic expression parser.  We hope that
this example gives you an idea of how you can use HOC to easily implement a GUI
for your existing Haskell applications!</p>
