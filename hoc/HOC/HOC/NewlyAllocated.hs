module HOC.NewlyAllocated where

{-
    Sending retain and release to objects that have been alloced, but not inited,
    doesn't work in all cases: Sometimes, an init method might decide to
    dealloc the original object --- if the finalizer in ID.hs releases it afterwards,
    we'll crash.
    
    So we introduce a special type for newly allocated objects --- basically
    just an unmanaged pointer. It should only live for a very short time between
    the call to alloc and the call to init.
