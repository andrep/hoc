This is a work-in-progress to add support for the Haskell language
and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler to Apple's Xcode IDE.  It requires
the SIMBL package[1].  Building this will result in a
XCodeHaskellSupport.bundle package, which you should place in your
"~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins" directory.

Warning: since this in in development right now, it will most likely
crash Xcode.
